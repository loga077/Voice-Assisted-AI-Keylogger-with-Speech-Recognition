Voice-Assisted AI Keylogger with Speech Recognition

A Python-based program that integrates a voice assistant, keylogger, and AI-powered natural language processing. This project listens for keyboard patterns, responds to voice commands, and generates intelligent responses using the AI21 Labs API.


🚀 Features

1.Keylogger: Captures keyboard input to trigger specific actions.

2.Voice Assistant: Uses speech recognition and text-to-speech for interaction.

3.AI Text Generation: Generates context-aware responses using AI21 Labs API.

4.Real-time Speech Recognition: Converts spoken words into text.

5.Audible Responses: Speaks responses for a seamless user experience.



🛠️ Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone  https://github.com/loga077/voice-ai-keylogger.git

cd voice-ai-keylogger


 
Install the dependencies:

pip install pynput pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition ai21

Replace the placeholder API key with your own from AI21 Labs:

client = AI21Client(api_key="your_api_key_here")+2



📋 Usage

1.Run the script:

python script_name.py

2.Trigger the assistant by pressing the space bar 10 times consecutively.

3.Speak your query into the microphone when prompted.

4.The assistant will:

  # Recognize your voice input.
  
  # Generate a response using the AI21 Labs API.
  
  # Speak the response audibly and repeat it for clarity.

  

  ⚙️ Requirements

1.Python 3.8 or later

2.Internet connection

3.Microphone (for speech recognition)



Python Libraries:

1.pynput: For capturing keyboard input.

2.pyttsx3: For converting text to speech.

3.SpeechRecognition: For converting speech to text.

4.ai21: For AI-powered text generation.




Install these using:

pip install pynput pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition ai21




🔧 Key Components

1.Keylogger: Listens for key presses and detects specific patterns.

2.Speech Recognition: Listens to your voice and converts it to text.

3.AI21 Integration: Processes your query and generates an intelligent response.

4.Text-to-Speech: Reads out the responses audibly.



🌟 Features to Improve

1.Custom Triggers: Add new trigger phrases for activating the assistant.

2.Enhanced Speech Models: Use advanced APIs for better accuracy.

3.Additional AI APIs: Expand response generation capabilities.
